			      Quarkus
....................................................................................

What is Quarkus?
  Quarkus is java or JEE frame work and platform to build "modern cloud native" or "container native" or desktop "native java applications".

The term native  is coined with different context

What is native?
  native is nothing but operating system.

cloud native : the cloud operating system
container native: The container's os like docker(linux)
desktop native: desktop operating system like linux,windows,mac

what is native application?
  Apps run on operating system without any vm abstractions.
eg: notepad,powerpoint ,word,browsers

Can you run java apps without JVM?

We cant run java apps without JVM..

But now a days 

We can run apps without jvm as well......

Why java was created?
  Java was created to build platform independant apps
  Java achives platform indepandent via "JVM".

 Yes! without jvm generally we cant run java apps
but Now a days without jvm also you can run java apps- do you know how?
"Native"

How to turn jvm based apps into native apps?

 native apps are written using "c" language.
 
java apps can be converted into c code and then you can deploy on "desk top or container operating system"

	The technology we have called "GraalVM and HotSpot"

Why jvm based technology is not suitable now days?

Now days, we deploy apps on the cloud , containers where we need application start up very fast,less memory foot print.

in order to build apps to target cloud,containers to imporve performance we need mordern tech stack - GraalVM.

..................................................................................
								 GraalVM How it was inspired
.................................................................................

In order to understand how GraalVM was created, We need to understand "Java compilers".

Types of compilers:

1.Source code compiler - java source code to byte code - javac

Types of source code compiler
 1.javac
 2.aot(ahead of time compilation) compiler	

2.Runtime compiler - JIT

Runtime Compiler: Hot Spot -Name of the Runtime compiler.

What is JIT?
  Runtime compiler,in Oracle JDK, Or Open JDK , the compiler name is "HotSpot".

java interpreter
  java interpreter is runtime which converts byte code into native code(os)
 
Runtime compiler- JIT
   java byte to native(optimization)code then it gives to interpreter.


Two types of JIT?

1.C1 Compiler
2.C2 Compiler

 Both are compilers which produce optimized code in order to excute by the interpreter.

When C1 was used and C2 used?

  ->C1 - Client - COREJAVA
  ->C2 - Server - J2EE

In olden days (before java 5), if you are running core java apps, in order to optimize 

 java -client MyApp
 
  Runtime uses C1 compiler to optimize the code ,before interpreter executes the      core java code .

 java -server MyApp
   
  Runtime uses C2 compiler to optimize the code ,before interpreter executes the        server side code .

From  Java 5 on wards, c1 became optional in server and core apps- "they merged one."

 From Java 5 , both compilers are used together.

  first c1 optimize the code, and later c2 optimize the code.


AOT and JIT
  Both are same , in order to improve code execution.

AOT : Before code execution, byte code been optimized..

JIT:  During code execution, byte code been optimized.
 C1 , C2

In java 8

java MyApp  (coimbine both c1 and c2)

Both c1 and c2 compiler written in c language.

Oracle wanted to optimize the "C2" Compiler in different way, Oracle wanted to use C2 compiler as pluggable compiler.

Oracle wanted to introduce new compiler in the place of "C2" - Pluggable compiler.


Java 9 proposed a spec called "c2" compiler in java language itself.

JEP: Java Enchancement Proposal....

JDK Features
  (JIT) compiler features

C1-->C2 => ?

C2--->JVMCI -- says any body can write compiler not in c/c++ rather java itself.

C2--->JAVA Compiler

Oracle wrote the first compiler in java based on JVMCI specification called "graal"
....................................................................................
				Graal Compiler
....................................................................................

Graal is first c2 plugable compiler written by Oracle based on "JVMCI" Specification.

After Java 11, Graal default c2 compiler.....

C2 ---GRAAL compiler------> GraallVM  is platform  inspired from "Graal Compiler"

Based on graal oracle created the technology called "GRAAL VM" Technology....

GrallVM = {native image,turfle framework}


GraalVM is extension of "Graal compiler" which was introduced in java 9 onwards.

GraalVM is just platform/tool to convert java apps into native binary apps.

Graal VM supports many other lanuages
 js,python,Ruby, R,WASM

Java Apps Running env
.....................

Running java apps with jvm mode.
...............................

1. Bare Metal desktop | Server
    os + JVM - windows + jvm 
2. Virtual Machine Env 
     where we can have more os - on that os we can have JVM...
3. Containers - Docker
     Where we can have light weight vm on which we can run java apps
     still we require JVM.
4. Cloud
      Where we can have os , vm or containers - still require JVM 


Running java apps without jvm mode -native mode.
.................................................
1. Bare Metal desktop | Server
    os - windows 
2. Virtual Machine Env 
     where we can have more os - on that os we dont need
3. Containers - Docker
     Where we can have light weight vm on which we can run java apps
     without jvm
4. Cloud
      Where we can have os , vm or containers we dont need jvm


You can run "Quarkus" apps 
   in two mode

=> JVM Mode -  Legacy
=> Native Mode - Modern
     =>Bare Metal Desktop - os can be any thing
     =>Container Native 
     =>Cloud Native

								Java Standards
.....................................................................................
Sun Micro systems setup a body/committee  in order to standarize the java technology.
  -JCP

What is JCP ?
 Java Community Process is non profitable organization whoes responsability is to standardize the java technology (java echo system).


What is JEP?
  JDK Enchament Proposal, Oracle own body to enchance the features of java
 The JDK Enhancement Proposal (or JEP) is a process drafted by Oracle Corporation for collecting proposals for enhancements to the Java Development Kit and OpenJDK.

		   				JEE Specification and implementations
.....................................................................................
  
Are we follwing entire jee specifications in java development?

Java frameworks such as spring framework has not implemented all jee specification.
spring has implemented core secifications  - servlet,jpa etc......

Why JEE Spec failed In Modern Computing?

     JEE Spec was developed to build traditional "Monolothic distributed,transactional, secure Applications".

Using JEE We cant build microservices, so that JEE spec failed....
.....................................................................................
.....................................................................................
How to build Micro services using java technology / on jvm?

Spring is framwork to build enterprise distributed apps.

Spring moto: 
 Dependency injection
 Automatic Configuration management system.
   -Spring uses xml based configuration
   -Spring uses annoation based java configuration
          ->automated annotation based java config
		->spring boot

Spring is just simple,automatic configuration system...


	Microservice is an architectural pattern to build distributed apps
		Microservice is collection of design patterns
			 to build enterprise apps

Microservices you can building using spring framework under there is project called
			"Spring cloud"

Spring cloud implements "Microservice design patterns"

.....................................................................................
					Fall of Spring Cloud in Microservice development
.....................................................................................

Old Spring cloud projects mostly rely on "NetFlix" OSS Components.

Spring Cloud microservice implementations was largly "Netflix".  

What was problem Spring faced?
  Spring introduced project which is not standardized by community like JCP.Which was propierty of Spring team.

What is the problem ?
  "Vendor lock"
  if any  new feature comes, we have to wait until spring team releases.

Spring was using "Netflix OSS" components in the begining, later Netflix stopped 
suport on many components,deprecated.
    "Failure of spring cloud projects started failing in the microservices develomement made java community very difficult."

IBM,RedHat,Oracle,Microsoft started thinking how to get out of "Vendor" lock based micro service development in java echo system.

 			   					 Birth of One Spec
		        			  "Micro Profile Spec"


.....................................................................................
	    What if i want to build standard based microservices based On JEE?

                       "MicroProfile Specfication"


Micro Profile addresses the need for enterprise "java microservices"

  It is set of secifications for handling "microservices design patterns" 

MicroProfile enables JEE Developers to leverage their existing skill set while shifiting their focus from traditional monolithic applications to Micro Services

SmallRye:
  It is the direct  reference implementation of MicroProfile Spec.
  Quarkus extends SmallRye for building micro servics ,Native Applications.

Ecplise Vert.x:
  Quarkus web apps are deployed on the top of "Vert.X Engine" which is eq to tomcat.
  We never use tomcat like blocking containers.
  Vertx modules(apis) also can be used inside Quarkus apps.

RestEasy:
	RestEasy is framework used to build  RESTful Web Services  based on JEE
JAX-RS Spec.
        RestEasy has been tailered to match modern microservices.

Hibernate:
      It is ORM framework used inside Quarkus to implement JPA based 

Mutiny:
    It is reactive lib used inside Quarks to enable non blocking,async reactive programming.

Quarkus Features:

1.Implements MicroProfile specification via smallRye project
2.Quarkus implements Reactive Stack via smallRye Muntiny
3.Quarkus implements non blocking architecture via Vert.x Engine
4.Quarkus supports Kubernets,docker ready images
5.Quarkus supports native apps via GraalVM
     -Mandrel: A specialized distribution of GraalVM for Quarkus
6.Quarkus supports hot reloading

							Quarkus Apps


Micro service is mini application.

Application means collection of objects.

Objects are collection of apis.

API Technology
..............

1.RESTFull api
2.Soap Web service
3.graphql 
4.grpc
5.Messaging api like kafka/rabbitmq ,


In Quarkus we can design REST API,GRAPHQL API,Grpc API,Messaging api

What is non blocking io and Blocking io?

Blocking, And Non Blocking;
...........................
File Descriptor is just c program
File descriptor is just array
For every process there is single file descriptor
When ever the process is created, file descriptor is initalized
File descriptor is bridge bewteen application process and io channels
File descriptor stores about information about hardware information like its address.
file descriptor is just table created by array using c language.
file descriptor is key-value paire structure using index and value
How io operations are happing in the process and operating system?

Let us take java application.

Java apps are running on JVM.

JVM is just process to the operating system

How to write simple io operations - reading from file?

private String readFromInputStream(InputStream inputStream)
  throws IOException {
    StringBuilder resultStringBuilder = new StringBuilder();
    try (BufferedReader br
      = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream))) {
        String line;
        while ((line = br.readLine()) != null) {
            resultStringBuilder.append(line).append("\n");
        }
    }
  return resultStringBuilder.toString();
}

In the above code?
  readLine() method is used to read byte of data from the IO Channel(hard disk).
.....................................................................................
			Blocking IO and Threading (Multi threading)
...................................................................................

In threading env, thread is blocked, until the data is available , thread cant continue other jobs.
.....................................................................................
.....................................................................................
				Use Case: WebServer
....................................................................................
if more request, more threads are created.

What if i create more threads?

Evils of Threads:

1.when you create thread

 ->It requires some amount of memory
  if you create more threads, it requires more memory

2.in order to manage memory, in 2000 linux os , introduced a concept called context switch.
   if any thread is not used for particular period of time, that thread is moved into passive state, once the data is available it can be brought back - CPU does this job.


C10K problem:
  How to reduce threads, if you reduce threads, you can save memory and cpu.

if you want to reduce thread,you have to look at different way of writing io programs,

Each user(io) request is mapped against one single thread.

			 Birth of Non Blocking IO Arch
.....................................................................................
Non Blocking implementation in linux:


1.select + read
  select makes api call to the kernal and return control back to process
  Process keeps on calling kernal with read method in order to read data...

2.Poll api
   Poll is second api which improved select where as poll pushes data from the kernal  to application process rather than explcit read call from the application.
  Poll introduced new programming model inside kernal called "Event Driven"


3.Epoll api

  EPoll is Third api which improved poll where as poll pushes data from the kernal to application process rather than explcit read call from the application.
  Poll introduced new programming model inside kernal called "Event Driven"

.....................................................................................
.....................................................................................
			IO Multiplxing implementations
....................................................................................

1.nginx
   This is first non blocking webserver based on c10k problem.

2.Node.js
   This is second reference implementation based on non blocking arch

These both implementations written in linux,that linux only supported non blocking apis.

Later windows,mac,other Open BSD os introduced non blocking io apis....


Epoll – Linux
Kqueue –Open BSD including mac
IOCP - Windows
.....................................................................................
			   Vertx Threading Model
.....................................................................................

Vertx provides two types of threads

1.Non Blocking threads  aka Event loop threads
   To handle non blocking io operations like webservers,tcp servers ...
2.Blocking threads/Worker threads
   To handle one thread , one job.


How many non blocking threads per process(jvm)?

 in node js , only one thread- This is limitation.
 in vertx multiple non blocking threads - per cpu =2 threads
  12 *2 =24
  50*2 =100

 incase of multiple event loop threads, which thread handles request?

  Vertx uses an algorthim called "round robin"

  request-1 - t1
  request-2 -t2
  request-24 -t24
  request-25-t1
.....................................................................................
				Roles of thread

1.Get IO REQUEST,deligate to kernal
2.Process events which dispatched from the kernal

 					 	 Reactive Programming using Muntiny
.....................................................................................
Reactive programming is programming style to build distirbuted apps using event driven style.

Reactive programming can be implemented in any language.

Java and Reactive Programming;
...............................

1.RxJava
2.Project Reactor
  Spring internally uses Project Reactor - webflex
3.SmallRye Mutiny - Red hat developed lib

1.Mutiny was built by Red hat team,relased under smallRye project
2.Mutiny first integrated with Quarkus, later with Vertx.
3.Mutiny is reactive stream certified
4.Mutiny is the perfect companion to tame the async nature of apps with non blocking io.

....................................................................................
			 Core Concepts of Muntiny
....................................................................................

Publisher:
  Object - Provider of data 
  Who publish events
Subscriber:
  Object - Receiver of data
  Who listens for events
Subscription -
   Object who conects Publisher and Subscriber in back end.
Operators 
   Are apis provided to process "stream of data"

Events: - data,error,complete

1.onItem -  onData - -> data event published by publisher when ever the data is available
2.onFailure - onError - error event published by publisher when ever the error occurred.
3.onComplete -  No more data /error published by publisher...


Muntiny Publishers Types:

1.Uni 
  Emit o or 1 item
  Mono in spring
2.Multi 
   1..to Many items - Stream
 Flux in Spring


Steps:
1.create plain maven project and add mutiny dependency.

1.create Publisher
2.emits data or error events
3.subscribe for data or error events.


package com.ibm;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

public class HelloMutiny {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        //create Uni object and emit Hello data(stream) - as soon as data is emitted, the subscriber
        //who has attached will receive data(event)
        Uni.createFrom().item("Hello").subscribe().with(data->{
            System.out.println(data);
        });
    }
}

Publisher and Subscriber:
package com.ibm;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

class Publisher {
    public static Uni<String> publish() {
        return Uni.createFrom().item("Hello");
    }
}

public class PublisherAndSubscriber {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
     Publisher.publish().subscribe().with(System.out::println);
    }
}

How to emit error Event

package com.ibm;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

public class ErrorEvent {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Uni.createFrom().failure(new RuntimeException("oops")).subscribe().with(data->{},err->{
            System.out.println(err);
        });
    }
}

Biz logic with Uni:
..................
package com.ibm;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

class Auth {

    public  static  Uni auth(String name,String password){
        if(name.equals("admin") && password.equals("admin")){
            return Uni.createFrom().item("Login success");
        }
        return Uni.createFrom().item("Login failed");
    }
}

public class Login {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
         Auth.auth("admin","admin").subscribe().with(System.out::println);
        Auth.auth("foo","admin").subscribe().with(System.out::println);

    }
}
....................................................................................
			  Data Pipe lines
...................................................................................

package com.ibm;

import io.smallrye.mutiny.Uni;

import java.time.Duration;

public class UniPipeDataPipeLine {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Uni.createFrom().item("hello")
                .onItem().transform(data->data.toUpperCase())
                .onItem().delayIt().by(Duration.ofMillis(10000))
                .subscribe().with(System.out::println);
    }
}
..................................................................................
